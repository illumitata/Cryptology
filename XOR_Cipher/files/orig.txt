im like oh shit i was messin with uh ddot also
people were like this started talking about the ghost production but thats
how i got in the game if it wasnt for that i wouldnt be here so you know after
they picked that truth beat i was figuring i was gonna
do some more work but shit just wasnt poppin off like that i was stayin in chicago
i had my own apartment i be doin like just beats for local acts just to try to keep the
lights on and then to go out and buy get a pelle pelle off layaway get some jordans or
something or get a technomarine thats what we wore back then
i made this one beat where i sped up this harold melvin sample i played it for hip over the phone hes like oh
yo that shit is crazy jay might want it for this compilation album he doin called the dynasty and at that time
like the drums really werent soundin right to me so i went and um i was listening to dre chronic
at that time and really i just like bit the drums off xxplosive and put it like with it sped up sampled
and now its kind of like my whole style when it started when he rapped on this cant be life
and that was like really the first beat of that kind that was on the dynasty album
i could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound you know
i got to come in and track the beat and at the time i was still with my other management
i really wanted to roll with hip hop cause i i just needed some fresh air you know what
im sayin cause i been there for a while i appreciated what they did for me but you know theres
a time in every mans life where he gotta make a change try to move up to the next level
and that day i came and i tracked the beat and i got to meet jayz and he said oh you a real soulful dude
and i was like man that shit tight you know what im sayin
man what ima tell him i was on the train man you know
i unpacked all my shit you know we went to ikea i bought a bed i put the bed together myself
i loaded up all my equipment and the first beat i made was uh heart of the city and beans was
still working on his album at that time so i came up there to baseline it was beans birthday
matter of fact and i played like seven beats and you know i guess he was in the
zone he already
had the beats that he wanted i had did nothing like it already at that
time but then jay walked in
i remember he had a gucci bucket hat on i remember it like like it was yesterday and hiphop said yo play that one beat for him
and i played heart of the city and really i made heart of the city i really
wanted to give that beat
to dmx
and i played another beat and i played another beat and i remember that gucci
bucket he took it and like put
it over his face and made one of them faces like ooooooooooh two days later im in
baseline and i seen dame
dame didnt know who i was and i was like
yo whats up im kanye
you know i aint talkin shit im like oh shit and all this time im starstruck man
im still thinking bout you know im picturing these niggas on the show the streets is watching
im lookin these were superstars in my eyes and
they still are you know so jay came in and he spit all
these songs like in one day and in two days i gotta bring up one
thing you know come back to the story
the day i did the cant be life beat on track i remember lenny
he had some louis vuitton sneakers on he think he fly and hip hop was there i
think tyty john meneilly a bunch of people
i didnt know all these people at the time they was in the room and i said yo jay i could rap and i spit this rap that said
uh im killin yall niggas on that lyrical shit mayonnaise colored benz i push miracle whips and i saw his eyes light up when i said that line
but you know the rest the rap was like real wack and shit
so thats all the response he said man that was tight
