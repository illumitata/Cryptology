then to go out and buy get a pelle pelle off layaway get some j
ordans or something or get a technomarine thats what we wore ba
ck then i made this one beat where i sped up this harold melvin
 sample i played it for hip over the phone hes like oh yo that 
shit is crazy jay might want it for this compilation album he d
oin called the dynasty and at that time like the drums really w
erent soundin right to me so i went and um i was listening to d
re chronic at that time and really i just like bit the drums of
f xxplosive and put it like with it sped up sampled and now its
 kind of like my whole style when it started when he rapped on 
this cant be life and that was like really the first beat of th
at kind that was on the dynasty album i could say that was the 
the resurgence of the soul sound you know i got to come in and 
track the beat and at the time i was still with my other manage
ment i really wanted to roll with hip hop cause i i just needed
 some fresh air you know what im sayin cause i been there for a
 while i appreciated what they did for me but you know theres a
 time in every mans life where he gotta make a change try to mo
ve up to the next level and that day i came and i tracked the b
